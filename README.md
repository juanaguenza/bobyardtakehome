# Status

Only finished the backend, was not able to get to the frontend in time.

## Tech Stack

- Typescript
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL (ElephantSQL for hosting for a small free db)

## Running the backend

Navigate to ~/backend

Run the backend by first compiling the ts files into js through npm run build,
then run npm run start to start the server

## Testing the backend

Here is a link to the [postman collection](https://www.postman.com/jaguenza/workspace/bobyard-takehome) I used for testing

## If I had more time

If I had more time I would have began implementing a basic frontend to start
displaying the information. My plan was to utilize [shadcn's open source
component "Card"](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card) and modify it to display the comments. After that I would begin to incorporate the features of Part 3 to allow comments to be updated and created directly from the frontend. After getting a working frontend and backend I would begin to implement testing and documentation for the backend endpoints utilizing Swagger.
